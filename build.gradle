/*
* The application plugin is not necessary for running or making a .jar file.
* However, I prefer to use it to make distribution files with .bat scripts.
* This way, the application can run on any windows without JDK or developer tools.
* For distribution, make sure to use the "boot" labled file at the ./build/distribution folder.
*
* The other files created have scripts that will not work.
* That is because the application plugin puts inside itself the result of the spring boot plugin.
* Hence, the application is inside another application (itself) and the script fails.
* This failure is due to the project folder structure becoming messy.
